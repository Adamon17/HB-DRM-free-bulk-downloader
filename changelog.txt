----------------------
HB DRM-free bulk downloader 0.3
----------------------
- Internet Explorer instance is closed at the start of downloading bundle files now (instead of at the end)
- you're no longer left with an invisible Internet Explorer instance when you close downloader before it finishes downloading

----------------------
HB DRM-free bulk downloader 0.2
----------------------
- added support for folder/file paths with the 260+ character length
- added support for global and link preferred label/suffix/extension

To specify your preferred label/extension/format for link only, use:
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#pdf
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX#pdf,epub,mp3
- link preferred label will always override global one

for global preferred label use:
- #pdf
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
- https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
- #none (default, this will return to downloading all versions)
- if some book/game/audio doesn't have preferred label, it'll download first label (unless overridden by %strict)

platform global switches:
- @windows (default)
- @mac
- @linux
- all of them works but it has to be the exact wording (e.g. @android)

other global switches:
- %strict (this will download only your preferred label)
- %normal (default, this will return to downloading at least 1 label)
- %pref (default, download first found preferred label in list and skip others)
- %all (download all preferred labels)

They can be used together in one line:
- %strict,pref (this would download only 1 specified label and skip others, even those without the pref label)

only # and % switches supports multiple parameters

----------------------
HB books bulk downloader 0.1
----------------------
It's a powershell script (It should work for Windows 7+) which allows you to download books from humble bundle pages (https://www.humblebundle.com/downloads?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX) in bulk.
It uses Internet Explorer instance to retrieve the links so all you need to do is login to humble bundle through the internet explorer and that's it.

Right now the script puts bundle into its own folder, each book into the subfolder and all versions inside. The download is sequential for now.
I'll add some options later, like download only some versions (pdf, epub, etc..) and maybe different folder sorting by book version instead of book name (for example, all pdf in one folder).

Powershell ExecutionPolicy change
----------------------
start RUN.bat to launch the script
for editing the script itself open HB-books_download.ps1 in notepad (or notepad++,etc...)

If the window closes fast after starting RUN.bat (or it doesn't show on startup when using that option): 
1. Go to any folder (file explorer) and choose file > open windows powershell > 
   > open windows powershell as administrator.
2. In the Windows PowerShell window type: get-ExecutionPolicy.
3. If you are geting the 'Restricted' text, type: set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned,
   then just confirm with y for yes.
4. After that the RUN.bat should work as intented.

If you'd like to create a shortcut for the script, you just need to make shortcut of RUN.bat file.
